# Pace App

##

App that organizes life by connecting humans to calendars. It edits calendar events locally on mobile to create an organized schedule privately. Privacy comes from functionality being fully contained locally, no internet connections required. Calendars sync between logged-in instances with Google/Apple accounts, leveraging existing sync infrastructure.
